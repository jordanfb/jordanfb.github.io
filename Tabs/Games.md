Here are some of the games I'm most proud of!

I also assisted with the release processes of 5+ games while working at <a href="https://controlzee.com" target="_blank">ControlZee</a> including asset optimizations, ownership and dependency changes, and the CI/CD pipelines. I did not directly work on the content of the games (aside from playtesting) so I haven't listed them here, but you can learn more about those processes and tools on my <b>[Tools](Tools)</b> page.
