        You found this! I have no clue if anyone will find this so if you did then awesome!
        If you found it the "correct" way instead of poking around in the source code then I'm a big fan. If you found it by poking around in the source code then goodness knows that's the only way I was able to finish this was by poking around in other code so go for it.
        I'm super surprised I'm actually able to finish this site wow my brain was melting.
        Have a good day and stay safe!
        I hope you enjoy my games!
