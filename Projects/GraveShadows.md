Developed in Unity for a semester long class in 2019, we submitted Grave Shadows to the E3 2019 College Game Competition and were one of five finalist games picked to showcase in person at E3 out of <a href="https://6abc.com/post/drexel-students-win-e3-college-game-competition/5346550/" target=null>more than four hundred</a> submissions. It was an incredible honor to be picked and to show off our game to the industry. While we didn’t win we learned an incredible amount along the way about game development, interfacing with publishers and contractors (we didn’t use any for development but were considering expanding the team after E3), and showcasing our work.

Part of a team of six. I programmed the NPCs, the dialog system and tooling, the detective yarnboard UI with a full undo/redo stack and narrative scripting tools to simplify the process of getting conversations into the game.
