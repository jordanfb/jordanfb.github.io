Sole programmer, art by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/grantdoney/" target=null>Grant Doney</a> and I. Contract music by <a href="https://soundcloud.com/axelstewart" target=null>Axel Stewart</a>. Development started in 2020, released October 6th, 2021 on Steam.

Some points of interest include:

* Physics based dice rolling but with the ability to predetermine outcomes without affecting the gameplay or visuals
