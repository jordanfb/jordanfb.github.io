This page is still in progress, sorry!


Godot Mod Loader - Godot, GDScript, GLSL, JSON					      2023-2025
Sole programmer. Implemented mod support for Godot projects that allow mods to modify other mods. System loads assets (textures, models, content, scripts, etc.) at runtime and supports swapping mods without restarting the game. Used in a train layout game still under development.
Non-destructive Runtime Terrain Editing - Godot, GDScript, GLSL			      2024-2025
Sole programmer. Created a heightmap terrain building tool that blends hand authored (ahead of time or using tools I developed) heightmaps+splatmaps with buildings and roads placed in engine.
Blender to Godot Foliage Pipeline - Godot, GLSL, Python, Blender				   2025
Sole programmer. Python Blender scripting to “fluff up” foliage and set custom data for animation. Godot GLSL shaders to display and animate in game. Transitions to LOD meshes.
