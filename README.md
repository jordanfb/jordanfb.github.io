## I'm Jordan Faas-Bush

I've released a game on Steam, made tools with a couple thousand downloads, and enticed you to click on this link. Knowing your exquisite taste I'm sure the third was the hardest. I always knew I was going to be a programmer but I didn't always know I was going to work in the games industry. What keeps me here is the cross discipline creativity, the interesting problems to solve, and the joy I get when something I made makes someone's day better. That's why I want to make tools to streamline your job.
